## Project Overview

This application allows users to post and view comments in real-time, making it a practical tool for community engagement. By using modern frameworks and technologies, I have created a responsive and user-friendly interface that enhances the user experience.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Comments**: Comments are displayed immediately upon submission without needing to refresh the page.
- **User Authentication**: Simple user registration and login system for personalized experiences.
- **Persistent Storage**: All comments are stored in a MySQL database, ensuring they persist across sessions.
- **Timestamps**: Each comment is timestamped automatically to show when it was posted.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring accessibility for all users.
- **Input Validation**: Client-side validation prevents empty submissions for username and comments, enhancing data integrity.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**:
  - **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime for efficient backend logic.
  - **Express.js**: Framework to build robust APIs and handle routing.
  - **Socket.IO**: Real-time communication between the client and server for instant updates.
  - **MySQL**: Relational database for structured data storage.

- **Frontend**:
  - **React**: For building dynamic user interfaces with reusable components.
  - **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
  - **Material-UI**: Pre-styled components for a modern and responsive UI design.
